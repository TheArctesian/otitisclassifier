# Multi-Dataset Integration Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for integrating 4 validated medical datasets into a unified otitis classification system. The integration follows industry best practices for multi-institutional medical AI studies and ensures robust cross-dataset validation.

## Dataset Sources

### Primary Datasets
1. **Ebasaran-Kaggle** (956 images) - Primary training dataset with comprehensive 9-class coverage
2. **UCI-Kaggle** (~900+ images) - High-volume dataset for major class reinforcement
3. **VanAk-Figshare** (~270+ images) - External validation dataset for generalization testing
4. **Sumotosima-GitHub** (38+ cases) - Clinical text annotations for interpretation validation

### Dataset Roles

| Dataset | Role | Usage | Format | Priority |
|---------|------|-------|---------|----------|
| Ebasaran-Kaggle | Primary Training | Model development, initial validation | TIFF | Critical |
| UCI-Kaggle | Training Supplement | Class balance improvement | JPG | High |
| VanAk-Figshare | External Validation | Generalization assessment | PNG | High |
| Sumotosima-GitHub | Clinical Validation | Expert interpretation comparison | CSV | Medium |

## Integration Strategy

### Phase 1: Dataset Validation and Processing
- Validate all dataset paths and structure integrity
- Apply consistent CLAHE preprocessing across all formats
- Standardize image resolution to 500×500 pixels
- Convert all images to unified format (JPG) for consistency

### Phase 2: Class Mapping and Standardization
- Map dataset-specific class names to unified 9-class taxonomy
- Handle naming variations and synonyms across datasets
- Validate mapping completeness and accuracy
- Document class correspondence for reproducibility

### Phase 3: Source-Aware Data Splitting
- **Training Set**: Ebasaran-Kaggle + UCI-Kaggle (stratified combination)
- **Validation Set**: Hold-out portion from training datasets (20%)
- **External Test Set**: VanAk-Figshare (completely separate source)
- **Clinical Validation**: Sumotosima annotations for interpretation checking

### Phase 4: Quality Assurance and Validation
- Cross-dataset duplicate detection using perceptual hashing
- Image quality validation and outlier detection
- Class distribution analysis and imbalance assessment
- Processing pipeline validation and benchmarking

## Technical Implementation

### Configuration Management
- Use Hydra framework for hierarchical configuration management
- YAML-based configuration files for reproducibility
- Environment-specific overrides for development/production

### Data Processing Pipeline
```
Raw Datasets → Format Validation → Preprocessing → Class Mapping → Quality Validation → Unified Dataset
```

### Processing Scripts
- `scripts/process_all_datasets.py` - Main processing pipeline
- `scripts/create_combined_dataset.py` - Dataset combination and splitting
- `scripts/validate_data_integrity.py` - Comprehensive validation

## Class Mapping Strategy

### Unified Class Taxonomy (9 Classes)
1. **Normal_Tympanic_Membrane** - Healthy eardrum
2. **Acute_Otitis_Media** - Active middle ear infection
3. **Chronic_Otitis_Media** - Persistent middle ear pathology
4. **Cerumen_Impaction** - Earwax blockage
5. **Otitis_Externa** - Outer ear canal inflammation
6. **Myringosclerosis** - Eardrum scarring/calcification
7. **Tympanostomy_Tubes** - Surgical ventilation tubes
8. **Foreign_Bodies** - Objects in ear canal
9. **Pseudo_Membranes** - False membrane formations

### Cross-Dataset Mapping
```yaml
# Example mapping (to be completed during implementation)
ebasaran_kaggle:
  "Normal" → "Normal_Tympanic_Membrane"
  "Aom" → "Acute_Otitis_Media"
  "Chornic" → "Chronic_Otitis_Media"  # Note: original typo preserved
  "Earwax" → "Cerumen_Impaction"
  # ... complete mapping

uci_kaggle:
  "Normal" → "Normal_Tympanic_Membrane"
  "Acute Otitis Media" → "Acute_Otitis_Media"
  "Cerumen Impaction" → "Cerumen_Impaction"
  # ... complete mapping
```

## Validation Strategy

### Cross-Dataset Validation Approach
1. **Internal Validation**: Stratified splits within combined training data
2. **External Validation**: VanAk-Figshare as completely separate test set
3. **Clinical Validation**: Sumotosima expert annotations for interpretation
4. **Source-Aware Evaluation**: Performance analysis by dataset source

### Quality Metrics
- Image integrity and format consistency
- Class distribution balance across sources
- Cross-dataset duplicate detection
- Processing pipeline performance benchmarks

### Performance Expectations
| Metric | Target | Rationale |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| Overall Accuracy | >90% | Clinical decision support requirement |
| Cross-Dataset Stability | <5% variance | Generalization validation |
| Processing Speed | <1s per image | Real-time clinical workflow |
| Duplicate Rate | <1% | Data quality assurance |

## Clinical Integration Context

### Multi-Modal System Integration
- Image classification provides **40% weight** in final diagnostic decision
- Integration with symptom assessment (35%) and patient history (25%)
- Clinical decision support with confidence-based recommendations
- Safety protocols for low-confidence cases requiring human review

### Regulatory Considerations
- FDA guidelines compliance for medical AI validation
- Cross-institutional validation following medical device standards
- Documentation requirements for regulatory submission
- Clinical trial protocol alignment
