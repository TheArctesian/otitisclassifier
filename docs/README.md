# Multi-Modal Ear Diagnosis System - Documentation

## Overview

This documentation provides comprehensive guidance for developing and implementing a multi-modal ear infection/disease diagnosis system. The system combines **dual architecture image classification**, symptom assessment, and patient history through an enhanced decision tree framework to provide evidence-based diagnostic recommendations.

**ðŸ†• Current Status**: The image classification component has been implemented with an **enhanced dual architecture medical AI training framework** featuring 2,363 processed PNG images at 500x500 resolution across 9 ear conditions. The system now employs parallel hierarchical classification with binary screening and multi-class diagnostic models. See the main `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` for development details.
