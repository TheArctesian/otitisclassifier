The Otoscopic Data dataset consists of 3,000 otoscopic images, categorized into five medical conditions:

# Categories & Image Count

- Acute Otitis Media → 600 images
- Cerumen Impaction → 600 images
- Chronic Otitis Media → 600 images
- Myringosclerosis → 600 images
- Normal (Healthy cases) → 600 images

All images are in `JPEG` (.jpg) format.

# Otoscopic Data Class Descriptions

## Acute Otitis Media (AOM)
A bacterial or viral infection causing inflammation and fluid buildup behind the eardrum. 

It presents with redness bulging of the tympanic membrane/

Can lead to ear pain, fever, and hearing loss.

## Cerumen Impaction (CI)
Occurs when excessive earwax builds up, blocking the ear canal and potentially causing hearing impairment. 

It can lead to symptoms like ear fullness, tinnitus, dizziness, and temporary hearing loss if left untreated.

## Chronic Otitis Media (COM)
Is a persistent ear infection leading to long-term damage, often characterized by perforation of the eardrum and discharge. 

It can result in conductive hearing loss and may require surgical intervention if complications arise.

## Myringosclerosis (MG) 
Is the formation of calcified plaques on the tympanic membrane due to recurrent infections or chronic inflammation.

It can cause eardrum stiffening, leading to mild hearing loss, but usually does not require treatment unless severe.

## Normal (HE)
Show a translucent, pearly-grey tympanic membrane with no signs of infection, fluid accumulation, or structural abnormalities. 

A healthy ear canal is free of **excessive cerumen**, inflammation, or perforations, allowing proper sound conduction. (wtf?)
