## Project Overview

This is a comprehensive multi-modal ear infection diagnosis system that combines three key components: **Enhanced Image Classification with Color Features and Regional Analysis**, **Symptom Assessment via iPad interface**, and **Patient History Integration**. The enhanced dual architecture image classification system serves as a core component (40% weight) in the larger multi-modal diagnostic system that uses decision tree logic to combine all inputs and provide evidence-based diagnostic recommendations with anatomical region-specific insights.

### Using the Enhanced Dual Architecture Training System

**Binary Screening Model (IMPLEMENTED - Stage 1):**
```python
from src.models.binary_screening import create_binary_screening_model

# Create production-ready binary screening model
model = create_binary_screening_model()

# Clinical prediction with confidence calibration
results = model.predict_with_confidence(images)
pathology_probs = results['pathology_probability']  # [0-1] confidence scores
clinical_decisions = results['clinical_decision']   # Specialist referral flags
```

**Dual Architecture Medical AI Training (Production approach):**
```python
from src.data.stage_based_loader import create_medical_ai_datasets
from src.models.binary_screening import BinaryScreeningModel
from src.models.multiclass_diagnostic import MultiClassDiagnosticModel

# Create dual architecture dataset manager
dataset_manager = create_medical_ai_datasets(
    base_training_path="data/processed/ebasaran-kaggale",
    fine_tuning_path="data/processed/uci-kaggle",
    validation_path="data/processed/vanak-figshare",
    image_size=500,  # Full resolution preservation
    dual_architecture=True  # Enable dual model data routing
)

# Stage 1: Binary screening training (Normal vs Pathological) - IMPLEMENTED
screening_model = BinaryScreeningModel()
screening_loaders = dataset_manager.get_binary_screening_dataloaders(batch_size=32)
train_loader = screening_loaders['train']
val_loader = screening_loaders['val']

# Stage 2: Multi-class diagnostic training (8 pathological classes only) - NEXT PHASE
diagnostic_model = MultiClassDiagnosticModel(num_pathology_classes=8)
diagnostic_loaders = dataset_manager.get_diagnostic_dataloaders(batch_size=16)

# Stage 3: External validation for both models
validation_loaders = dataset_manager.get_stage_dataloaders('validation', batch_size=32)
test_loader = validation_loaders['test']
```

**Simple Dataset Loading (For development/testing):**
from src.data.loader import create_simple_dataset
from src.utils import create_dataloader

# Create single dataset for testing
dataset = create_simple_dataset('data/processed/ebasaran-kaggale', image_size=500)
dataloader = create_dataloader(dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)

### Unix Philosophy Implementation for Dual Architecture

The codebase has been enhanced to follow Unix philosophy principles with dual model support:

- `create_dual_model_system()` composes individual model components

**3. "Make it modular"**
