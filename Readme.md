## Usage Examples

### Enhanced Dual Architecture Training
from src.data.stage_based_loader import create_medical_ai_datasets
from src.models.binary_screening import BinaryScreeningModel
from src.models.multiclass_diagnostic import MultiClassDiagnosticModel

# Create dual architecture dataset manager
dataset_manager = create_medical_ai_datasets(
    base_training_path="data/processed/ebasaran-kaggale",
    fine_tuning_path="data/processed/uci-kaggle",
    validation_path="data/processed/vanak-figshare",
    image_size=500,  # Full resolution preservation
    dual_architecture=True  # Enable dual model data routing
)

# Stage 1: Binary screening training (Normal vs Pathological)
screening_model = BinaryScreeningModel()
screening_loaders = dataset_manager.get_binary_screening_dataloaders(batch_size=32)

# Stage 2: Multi-class diagnostic training (8 pathological classes only)
diagnostic_model = MultiClassDiagnosticModel(num_pathology_classes=8)
diagnostic_loaders = dataset_manager.get_diagnostic_dataloaders(batch_size=16)

### Simple Dataset Loading (Development/Testing)
from src.data.loader import create_simple_dataset
from src.utils import create_dataloader, print_dataset_info

# Load processed dataset
dataset = create_simple_dataset('data/processed/ebasaran-kaggale', image_size=224)
print_dataset_info(dataset)

# Create DataLoader  
dataloader = create_dataloader(dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)

# Use in training loop
for images, labels in dataloader:
    # images: [batch_size, 3, 224, 224]  
    # labels: [batch_size] (class indices)
    pass

## Enhanced Differential Augmentation Strategy
ENHANCED_AUGMENTATION = {
    'binary_screening': {
        'normal_cases': {'factor': 2, 'conservative': True},

    },
    'multi_class_diagnostic': {
        'Foreign_Bodies': {'factor': 20, 'aggressive': True},      # 3 → 60 images
        'Pseudo_Membranes': {'factor': 10, 'specialized': True},  # 11 → 110 images
